DF12-MobileComponents-Artifacts
===============================

All artifacts from the Using and Creating Visualforce Mobile Components session at Dreamforce 2012 are in this repository for later reference.

There are a few resources that contain code that demo simple Visualforce pages that use Mobile Component and simple jQuery Mobile pages as well.

The ThumbnailList walkthrough code has also been added to a directory in this repository.
