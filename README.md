DF12-MobileComponents-Artifacts
===============================

Artifacts from the Using and Creating Visualforce Mobile Components
session at Dreamforce 2012 are in this repository for later reference.

There are a few resources that demo simple Visualforce pages using
Mobile Components, as well as a few demos of simple jQuery Mobile
functionality.

The code for a ThumbnailList component has also been added to
a directory in this repository. This code is a fork of the original
version of the VF Mobile Components with extra pages and resources
for showing a ThumbnailList page. Any modified files should be
noted in the ChangeLog.txt file.
